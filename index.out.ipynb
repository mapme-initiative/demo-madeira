    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will conduct a practical analysis of geospatial data during which you will get to know the R package `mapme.biodiversity`. This package streamlines the access to and analysis of geospatial data sets that are relevant to conservation efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a practical example, we are going to analyze flooding and potentially associated deforestation as a consequence of dam building for electricity generation. Our area of study is a part of the river Madeira, a tributary to the Amazon, located in Rondônia, Brazil. Here, between 2008 and 2016 two dams, the Santo Antônio and the Jirau dam, were built in very close proximity to each other. This caused quite the stir, as an [report](https://www.maapprogram.org/madeira/) of the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP) estimated some 36,000 hectares of primary rainforest being permanently lost due to flooding ([Finer and Olexy 2015](#ref-finer2015)).\n",

    "Now that we have our raw inputs, we will have to design our specific AOIs. The Madeira river flows from the Andes toward the Amazon basin, that is from West to East. Flooding after dam construction evidently occurs upstream of a dam’s location, which is to the West in the case of the Madeira river. To analyze forest cover loss potentially associated with flooding we might decide to use a buffer zone around the river banks for a similar stretch of land upstream of both dams. The function we define below, will first crop the river’s line geometry to a specified buffer zone around a dam. We then have to decide which direction from the point’s location to keep, which should be West in the present case. We thus construct a directed bounding box and return the resulting river course after a final crop."

That changes for the Santo Antonio dam abruptly in 2012, where we observe a steep increase from ~9,000 ha to 13,500 ha of areas permanently covered in water. For the Jirau, the increase is delayed by a year and also with lower magnitude with an increase of about 3,000 ha. This pattern is, however, reversed with the seasonal water class were we see an absolute increase of about 10,000 ha for Jiaru while only about 2,000 ha for Santo Antonio."

    "With this we have some solid indication that treecover loss in both AOIs between 2007 to 2017 was mainly dominated by losses associated with flooding previously forested areas. However, as can be seen from the spatial visualization of the treecover loss year (<a href=\"#fig-gfw-lossyear\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 8</a>) there might also be other processes at work here contributing to the deforestation rates. An option to improve the presented methodology could be to spatially match the yearly surface water change maps with the treecover loss layer to construct a new indicator that calculates the area of treecover loss due to flooding.\n",

    "Lastly, we will take a look at the number of people living in a 50 km vicinity of the dams locations. For this, we will use another utility, called `portfolio_wide()`, which unpacks nested indicator columns to create a wide view of our portfolio data. Note, that the column names are quite predictable, though not perfectly legible.\n",
