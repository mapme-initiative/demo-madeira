    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will conduct a practical analysis of geospatial data during which you will get to know the R package `mapme.biodiversity`. This package streamlines the access to and analysis of geospatial data sets that are relevant to conservation efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a practical example, we are going to analyze flooding and potentially associated deforestation as a consequence of dam building for electricity generation. Our area of study is a part of the river Madeira, a tributary to the Amazon, located in Rondônia, Brazil. Here, between 2008 and 2016 two dams, the Santo Antônio and the Jirau dam, were build in very close proximity to each other. This caused quite the stir, as an [report](https://www.maapprogram.org/madeira/) of the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP) estimated some 36,000 hectares of primary rainforest being permanently lost due to flooding ([Finer and Olexy 2015](#ref-finer2015)).\n",

We see that to the North of the river the canopy cover is really dense (~100%) while we see parts with lower canopy cover on the South of the river banks. There, we can also see lower densities in proximity to linear structures that indicates potential human-driven deforestation along roads that already occurred prior to the year 2000."

To the North, we observe a domination of tree cover loss between 2010 and 2015 in more naturally shaped areas - an indication of tree cover loss associated with flooding the lowest areas as a result of raising water levels. To the South, we observe both, tree cover losses before and after 2010 mostly occurring in rectangular shapes, again an indication of human-driven deforestation in that areas."

    "With this we have some solid indication that treecover loss in both AOIs between 2007 to 2017 was mainly dominated by losses associated with flooding previously forested areas. However, as can be seen from the spatial visualization of the treecover loss year (<a href=\"#fig-gfw-lossyear\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 7</a>) there might also be other processes at work here contributing to the deforestation rates. An option to improve the presented methodology could be to spatially match the yearly surface water change maps with the treecover loss layer to construct a new indicator that calculates the area of treecover loss due to flooding.\n",

    "Lastly, we will take a look at the number of people living in a 50 km vicinity of the dams locations. For this, we will use another utility, called `portfolio_wide()`, which unpacks nested indicator columns to create a wide view of our portfolio data. Note, that the column names are quite predictable, though not perfectly legible.\n",

    "We see that WorldPop estimates about 500,000 people to live in the buffer zone of the Santo Antonio dam while only about 20,000 in the vicinity of the Jiaru dam. Looking up the number of inhabitants in [Porto Velho](https://datacommons.org/place/wikidataId/Q172512?utm_medium=explore&mprop=count&popt=Person&hl=en#) shows a pretty good level of agreement for this estimate."
